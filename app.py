The conversation set contains ten user queries, each asking for the company website in different ways. Users use various phrases like “Can you share the company website?”, “I want to explore your company. Got a link?”, “Link to your homepage?”, and “Deva, where’s the link to your product?” — all aiming to receive the company’s web URL. Some users refer to it as a homepage, while others ask to revisit the link they’ve seen before or simply request to explore the company or product. Despite the different wordings, the model consistently responds with the same message:
“Sure. Here's the website link: https://quantum-dev-xi.vercel.app/”.
This showcases that the model is designed to detect diverse user intents related to requesting the website and provide a clear, uniform response with the correct URL.
